# Bookmark

An effortless way to make landing pages for Reason libraries.  â–¾

Bookmark produces beautiful, fast-loading documentation pages for Reason projects
and bundles all of your rendered doc markup into a single shareable file, along
with all of its assets.

> Bookmark is a fork of the excellent
> [flatdoc](https://github.com/rstacruz/flatdoc)
project but with a lighter weight editing workflow, and faster loading of
published pages.
> Though it is a relatively minor fork of Flatdoc, it is renamed in this
> project to Bookmark in order to aggressively remove features from its API.

- **No build. No server.** Just edit, Bookmark.
- **Looks great** out of the box
- **Compresses** page into a single, sharable `.html` file.


### Looks <i data-feather="globe"></i>
- Optional Left/right split layout (thanks to flatdoc).
- Sticky navigation.

### Workflow

Bookmark markdown files have an `.html` file extension. This allows
buildless/serverless editing/loading.

1. Clone this project.
2. `README.html` is the main markdown file. Edit it.
3. Bookmark `site/index.dev.html`.

> Note: This starter project is set up with a `site/` directory to make it easy
> to drop all of Bookmark into your project just by copying the `site/`
> directory into your project.  The file `site/index.dev.html`, loads a
> markdown file named `README.html` located one directory up at your project
> root. `README.html` has the `.html` suffix but it is really a markdown file.

The `index.dev.html` file includes a script tag that runs `Bookmark` and
specifies which files should be loaded:

```html
<script>
Bookmark.go({ doc: "./README.md.html" });
</script>
```


### Docs

Docs use the `.html` or `.md.html` extension, and are standard markdown syntax,
but with the additional requirement of a single script tag on the first line.

```markdown
<script src="site/Bookmark.js"></script>
Everything _after_ the first line is
plain **markdown**.
```

<continueRight/>

See how to [Add More Docs](#customizing-add-files)

> Note: Using `.md.html` provides better clarity, but for a project's main
> `README`, the `.html` extension is better as Github will render it as your
> main project's README in markup if you follow
> [Integrations](#integration).


### Styles And.Stuff

Styles can be authored in plain `.css` and included in `index.dev.html` as a
regular css file, but Bookmark also supports [Stylus](stylus) files also without
any build step/server.  Stylus config goes into files with a `.html` file (or
preferably a `.styl.html` file - for clarity), and use standard Stylus syntax,
with the exception of requiring a single single script tag on the first line,
just as with markdown files.

```css
<script src="site/Bookmark.js"></script>
.title-area
  min-height: 100px
  box-sizing: border-box
  antialias()
  text-align: center
```

<continueRight/>

The default Stylus file is
[`theme-white/theme.styl.html`](theme-white/theme.styl.html). You may edit it
and reload the page to see the changes.

> Note: Check the console for errors parsing your Stylus syntax.

Create more `.styl.html` files and add them to the list of files in the
`stylusFetcher` loaded as explained in [Adding
Files](#customizing-add-files) section.

### Markdown Features

Bookmark supports Github Flavored markdown features, but also inheirits some
additional ones flatdoc. Bookmark also adds many of its own new features.  The
"buttons", smartquotes and left/right split features below was inherited from
flatdoc, and the other features are Bookmark specific features.

#### Buttons

Include a `>` at the end of your link text (for instance: `Continue >`), to
turn them into buttons. This is a feature from flatdoc.

> [Go To Github >][github]


#### Code highlighting

You can use Markdown code fences to make syntax-highlighted text. Code blocks
like this will end up in the right hand column when the window is sufficiently
wide. Surround your text with three backticks just like with [GitHub Flavored
Markdown][fences].

~~~markdown
```html
<strong>Hola, mundo</strong>
```
~~~

#### Medium-Zoom Images

Images are specified using standard markdown syntax, but they are enhanced with
a plugin called [Medium Zoom](https://medium-zoom.francoischalifour.com/).

```markdown
![Beach](site/logo.svg)
```

![Beach](site/images/beach.jpg)

> Click on the image to view a full view. Click, or scroll a small amount to
> cause the image to animate back into place.

<continueRight/>



#### Blockquotes

Blockquotes also show up in the right hand column when the window is
sufficiently large. This is useful for providing extra information or non-code
examples that move out of the way of the main document.

> Blockquotes are blocks that begin with `>`.

#### Smart quotes

Single quotes, double quotes, and double-hyphens are replaced to their
"typographically-accurate" equivalent. This does not apply to `<code>` and
`<pre>` blocks.

> "Check out this quote here. Look how how correct the quotes are"
> --me


#### `<continueRight/>`

Bookmark adds an additional feature that allows a right column element to continue
flowing.

> This blockquote comes immediately after the text
> _"Bookmark adds an additional feature that allows a right column element to
> continue flowing"_
> but notice how this blockquote also continues to "flow" into the list that
> comes after it? This is important for creating a better balance of left and
> right content. Doing so requires the author to opt into having particular
> blockquote/code blocks flow into subsequent left content when it makes sense.

<continueRight/>

- After a blockquote or code fence region, include a `<continueRight/>` tag.
- It will cause that blockquote/fence region to continue flowing into whatever
  comes after it in the left column.
- Until another blockquote or code fence region begins.

#### Images In Right Column

Images may also be placed into the right column of the document by placing
them in blockquotes.

```markdown
> ![Another Beach](site/images/beach2.jpg)
```

Like all other elements, you may place a `<continueRight/>` after blockquote
containing the image to get subsequent content to flow alongside the image on
its left side:

> ![Another Beach](site/images/beach2.jpg)

<continueRight/>


- Such as this list here
- **And this bold line here**

#### Code Tabs

You can create [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/doc-markdown) style
code toggle switches for viewing multiple different code samples. In this
example, clicking on the headers (reason, javascript, ocaml) will toggle
between different syntaxes for a particular print command.

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->
```reason
Console.log(["This", "Logs", "Reason", "Lists"]);
Library.callSomeFunction(10, 200);
```

```javascript
Console.log(["This", "Logs", "Reason", "Arrays"]);
library.callSomeFunction(10, 200);
```

```ocaml
Console.log ["This", "Logs", "Ocaml", "Lists"]
Library.callSomeFunction 10 200;
```
<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->



To create code tabs, place multiple code blocks between
special comments as follows:

````md
 <!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->
 ... multiple code blocks go here...
 <!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

````

#### Custom Tab Titles

By default, code tab titles are inferred from the code block syntaxes, but you
may give custom names to the tabs by including an HTML comment before each code
example.


> Note: Inferring the tab title from the code block syntax is a Bookmark feature,
> not supported in Docusaurus.

This example:

````md
 <!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->
   <!--Awesome JS-->
   ```js
   console.log('Hello, world!');
   ```
   
   <!--Python-->
   ```py
   print('Hello, world!')
   ```
 <!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

````

<continueRight/>

Produces the following toggle interface:

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

<!--Awesome JS-->
```js
console.log('Hello, world!');
```
<!--Python-->
```py
print('Hello, world!')
```
<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

#### YAML Headers

Bookmark parses valid YAML headers and extracts the metadata contained within them.
YAML headers are way to pass metadata that is _not_ part of standard markdown
to other parts of the documentation toolchain. YAML headers consist of an unlimited
number of key/value pairs sandwiched between two `---` appearing at the start of the
document. It must be the very first thing in the document, after the first Bookmark
`<script>` include line.

```markdown
---
something: hey
title: me
description: "Hi there here is an escaped quote \" inside of quotes"
---
```

#### Silent YAML Headers

YAML headers are the standard way to convey metadata to various markdown
documentation toolchains, and Bookmark will use some of that metadata as well.
However, one downside to YAML headers is that they are also rendered as a table
in your document when viewed in Github's markdown viewer.
Bookmark supports an alternative ("silent") form of YAML headers embedded in
markdown comments (markdown comments are of the form `[//]: #
(comment-content-here)`.

The previous example would be written at the very start of the Bookmark document
(after the script include) as follows:


```markdown
[//]: # (---)
[//]: # (something: hey)
[//]: # (title: me)
[//]: # (description: "Hi there here is an escaped quote \" inside of quotes")
[//]: # (---)
```


This prevents the header metadata from being rendered as a table in Github's viewer,
but Bookmark will still extract them just as if they were YAML headers.
The result is a single Bookmark doc that serves as a Github viewable markdown page,
as well as powering a website.


### Optimizing
You can deploy this repo and serve its files with no build step. But you can
also optimize your docs page into a single, minified `.html` file which bundles
all of its resources *including* fonts and images! There are many benefits to
the way Bookmark compresses your docs site into a single, shareable `.html` file.

```
cd site
npm install
npm run bundle
# Now deploy index.html
```

- Bookmark prerenders at build time instead of page load time (faster loading).
- A single web request for the entire page.
- Easily send the docs as an attachment in Discord/Messenger chat thread.
- Save your online docs using the browser's '"Save As"
- Bookmark makes sure your page looks exactly the same on anyone's computer,
  including the fonts.

## Search Features

Bookmark supports offline search of the current document. See the Bookmark
[API](#api) for how to instantiate it with the right information about
where your search form lives on the page.

## API

The following describe the properties accepted on the `Bookmark` constructor
which should be initialized in your main HTML `index.dev.html` or template.

```js
Bookmark.go({
  stylus: stylusConfig,
  doc: docConfig,
  highlight: highlightConfig,
  slugify: slugifyConfig,
  slugContributions: slugifyConfig,
  sideNavify: sideNavifyConfig,
  searchFormId: searchFormId,
  searchHitsId: searchHitsId,
});
```

###### `stylus:`
The path(s) to stylus configuration(s). May either be a string or an array of
strings. Each string must be the path to a valid Bookmark compatible [stylus
configuration](#styles) (Stylus files with the special script include on the
first line).

```javascript
Bookmark.go({
  stylus: './theme-white/theme.styl.html',
  ...
});
```

###### `doc:`
The path(s) to Bookmark doc(s). May either be a string or an array of strings.
Each string must be the path to a valid Bookmark compatible [doc ](#doc) files
(markdown files with the special script include on the first line).

```javascript
Bookmark.go({
  stylus: './theme-white/theme.styl.html',
  ...
});
```


###### `slugify:`

Describes which header elements should become slugified (linkable with a
readable url). The default is shown below.
```javascript
{
  h1: true,
  h2: true,
  h3: true,
  h4: false,
  h5: false,
  h6: false,
}

```

<continueRight/>

If a header level is not slugified, its content can still partake in the slug
content of other header levels. See [`slugContributions:`](#api-slugcontributions).

###### `slugContributions:`

Describes which header elements should partake in _other_, header slugs.
For example if `h1` is marked `true`, then `<h2/>`s will have the previous
`h1` text in their slugs. Consequently, if everything is configured `false`,
only *that* header's text will be used to create the slug.
Slugs are always deduped regardless of which headers are slug contributors.
The first slug of value `name` becomes `#name` and the second becomes `#name-1`
and so on. Enabling more slug contributions doesn't change the deduping
behavior, it just makes deduping less necessary.
The defaults are as follows:

```javascript
{
  h1: true,
  h2: true,
  h3: true,
  h4: false,
  h5: false,
  h6: false,
}
```

<continueRight/>

`slugContributions` can help you avoid breaking existing links to pages.  If
you never had an `h1` heading, and your existing slug urls did not have any
component for the `h1` heading, you can later add an `h1` heading without
breaking existing links by configuring the `slugContributions`'s `h1` field to
be `false.`

The more headings you allow to partake in slugs, the more fragile your links
will be. But the fewer headings you allow to partake in slugs, the more
non-unique slugs you will run into (with a `-1` appended after them).

###### `sidenavify:`

Describes which headings will be added to the side nav. This will also cause
the `slugify` to be activated for this heading level even if it was set to
`false` (only slugified headings can be linked to from the side nav).
The defaults are as follows:

```javascript
{
  h1: true,
  h2: true,
  h3: true,
  h4: false,
  h5: false,
  h6: false,
}
```


## Customizing

### Add Files

You can add more markdown docs (using the `.md.html`) or [Stylus](stylus) files
(using the `.styl.html` extension).  Then just add it to the list of files
loaded in `index.dev.html`'s script tag. The `doc` and `stylus` options accept
an array of paths.

```html
<script>
Bookmark.go({
  stylus: ["./path/to/YourStyle.styl.html"],
  doc: ["./path/to/YourDoc.md.html"]
});
</script>
```
<continueRight/>

- Stylus files should have the `.styl.html` extension, and be included in the
  `stylusFetcher:`.
- Markdown files shoud have the `.md.html` extension and be included in the
  `fetcher:`


### Highlighting

Bookmark includes a vendored [hljs](hljs), and it is enabled by default in the main
script tag in `index.dev.html` that runs `Bookmark`. `hljs` is by default configured
to be the highlighter, and you can customize this.


```html
<script>
Bookmark.go({
  stylus: ...,
  doc: ...,
  highlight: (txt, lan) =>
    hljs.highlight(lan, txt).lan;
});
</script>
```


### Fonts
Bookmark comes with two vendored fonts.

- [`fonts/CodingFont.css`](./fonts/CodingFont.css): a css inlined font named
  `CodingFont`
- [`fonts/WordFont.css`](./fonts/WordFont.css) a css inlined font named
  `WordFont`

These two font names are referenced in
[`theme-white/theme.styl.html`](theme-white/theme.styl.html). `CodingFont` is
actually `Fira`, and `WordFont` is actually `Roboto`, but they have been
renamed. See their respective licenses in [fonts/](./fonts).

### Customizing Font
You can either replace `CodingFont` and `WordFont` with two css files that
contain your desired fonts, but rename those fonts to be
`CodingFont`/`WordFont` respectively. This would work well if you are replacing
those fonts with an open licensed font.

If you want to use a proprietary font when publishing your page online, but
want to keep your documentation open source, Bookmark also supports a "layered"
approach. Two additional custom fonts (`PrivateCodingFont` and
`PrivateWordFont`) are automatically prioritized if they are present in the
repo.

- [`fonts/PrivateCodingFont.css`](./fonts/PrivateCodingFont.css), if present,
  should define a css inlined font named `PrivateCodingFont`.
- [`fonts/PrivateWordFont.css`](./fonts/PrivateWordFont.css), if present,
  should define a css inlined font named `PrivateWordFont`.

These allow you to keep the `CodingFont`/`WordFont` in a public Github repo,
but then locally define these private fonts which are never pushed publicly to
a repo. This allows you to easily open source every part of your docs site
except private fonts, which you personally use locally, and will push to
production.

Once you create the propper css files in those locations that define fonts
named `PrivateCodingFont` and `PrivateWordFont` respectively, those fonts will
be used to render code examples and text respectively, otherwise the included
`CodingFont` and `WordFont`  fonts will be used as a fallback.

Note: These private fonts are not present in this github repo, but you may
populate them with your custom fonts as follows:

#### Creating Font Files:

**Creating Your Own Private Font Files:**
To create your own `PrivateCodingFont.css`/`PrivateWordFont.css` use a site
like [https://transfonter.org/](tranfonter.org) to turn your prefered fonts
into inlined CSS fonts (Select `woff`, and select the `base64` option). Then
edit the resulting CSS file to change the name of the font to
`PrivateCodingFont` or `PrivateWordFont` and place them at
[`./fonts/PrivateCodingFont.css`](./fonts/PrivateCodingFont.css) and
[`./fonts/PrivateWordFont.css`](./fonts/PrivateWordFont.css) respectively.

## Integration

### Github README
This example project is already setup so that the main `README` file will
render as the Github project's README without any extra configuration. If you
copied this project as your starter, then your project is probably already
setup to render this main `README.html` file as the Github project README.

- Make sure you don't have some other `README.md` file in your repo that would
  take precedence over the `README.html`.
- Make sure your main doc page is named `README.html` and is located in your project root.
- Make sure `index.dev.html` loads `README.html` (it does by default).
- Change the first line of the `README.html` to be more than just a simple script tag.

Instead of `<script src="site/Bookmark.js"></script>`, make sure it is:

```markdown
[ vim: set filetype=Markdown: ]: # (<script src="site/Bookmark.js"></script>)
Your markdown here
as always
```

<continueRight/>

That line in a file named `README.html` accomplishes the following:

1. When you edit it in Vim it will detect the filetype as markdown.
2. When you view the file in Github it will render it as markdown instead of
   plain text (Github detects vim settings)
3. The script will load when you are loading the html file as a doc page in
   Bookmark.
4. The entire first line is entirely hidden when viewing the file as markdown
   in Github so it doesn't clutter up the Github viewing experience.

> How Does This Work? You don't need to care about this, but if you're curious,
> that syntax is actually a markdown link definition, with the link name
> between the `[ ]`. The name can be anything, and we've named it to something
> that tells both Vim and Github to treat the file as markdown regardless of
> the file extension. The contents after `#` are the link _location_ which can
> also be nearly anything, and we've set it to the script tag that needs to be
> loaded in any markdown doc file.

#### Alternative line:

Alternatively you could use the following line, with the only difference being
that the `.html` file will automatically be detected as markdown in Emacs
instead of Vim:

```markdown
[-*-mode:markdown-*-]: # (<script src="site/Bookmark.js"> </script>)
```

#### `.gitattributes` Approach:
TODO:

## More

### How It Works

`README.md.html` is both a valid html page and a valid markdown page. Because
browsers allow loading of html pages in iframes across origins, no web server
is needed to develop and reload docs entirely in the browser without a build
step/web server.

`README.md.html` looks like:

```markdown
<script src="site/Bookmark.js"></script>
Everything _after_ the first line is
plain **markdown**.
1. Nothing needs to be escaped.
2. Not even if your markdown contains
  a `<script>` tag.
```
<continueRight/>

Everything after the first line is plain markdown. There is nothing special you
need to do to your markdown even though it is in an `.html` file. You can
include literally any markdown after that first script tag line, and you don't
have to escape any of it. The browser won't even think you're starting a script
region if you include a `<script>` tag somewhere after the first line. How?
It's a wonderful hack. The inclusion of the first `Bookmark.js` script forces
the rest of the document to be interpreted as plain text that needn't be
escaped.

#### Safari Support:
Safari does not interpret the encoding of files as utf-8 by default unless the
html document has `<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="charset=UTF-8">` at
the top of the file.  That means any `.html` page, or style `.html` page must
have `<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="charset=UTF-8">` at the top, if
you want to be able to load it in Safari.  This primarily effects development
mode because normally you would perform a build of the site before deploying
it, where the encoding issue doesn't come up.

A complete markdown html file header that serves as a Github markdown page, can
be loaded in Chrome *and* Safari just by double clicking it, and automatically
detected as markdown syntax in Vim would look like:

```markdown
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="charset=UTF-8">

[ vim: set filetype=Markdown: ]: # (<script  charset="UTF-8" src="site/Bookmark.js"> </script>)
```

> Note: Make sure there is a space between the two (this makes sure github
> markdown rendering works correctly).

#### Issues:
You must only load markdown html files that you authored and trust. Currently,
the way that the `marked` library is being used does not sanitize the output
before injecting it into the DOM.
