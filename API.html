## Configuration Options

The following describe the properties accepted on the `Bookmark` constructor
which should be initialized in your `siteTemplate.html` file.

```js
Bookmark.go({
  stylus: stylusConfig,
  doc: docConfig,
  highlight: highlightConfig,
  slugify: slugifyConfig,
  slugContributions: slugifyConfig,
  sideNavify: sideNavifyConfig,
  searchFormId: searchFormId,
  searchHitsId: searchHitsId,
});
```

###### `stylus:`
The path(s) to stylus configuration(s). May either be a string or an array of
strings. Each string must be the path to a valid Bookmark compatible [stylus
configuration](#styles) (Stylus files with the special script include on the
first line).

```javascript
Bookmark.go({
  stylus: './theme-white/theme.styl.html',
  ...
});
```

###### `doc:`
The path(s) to Bookmark doc(s). May either be a string or an array of strings.
Each string must be the path to a valid Bookmark compatible [doc ](#doc) files
(markdown files with the special script include on the first line).

```javascript
Bookmark.go({
  stylus: './theme-white/theme.styl.html',
  ...
});
```


###### `slugify:`

Describes which header elements should become slugified (linkable with a
readable url). The default is shown below.
```javascript
{
  h1: true,
  h2: true,
  h3: true,
  h4: false,
  h5: false,
  h6: false,
}

```

<continueRight/>

If a header level is not slugified, its content can still partake in the slug
content of other header levels. See [`slugContributions:`](#api-slugcontributions).

###### `slugContributions:`

Describes which header elements should partake in _other_, header slugs.
For example if `h1` is marked `true`, then `<h2/>`s will have the previous
`h1` text in their slugs. Consequently, if everything is configured `false`,
only *that* header's text will be used to create the slug.
Slugs are always deduped regardless of which headers are slug contributors.
The first slug of value `name` becomes `#name` and the second becomes `#name-1`
and so on. Enabling more slug contributions doesn't change the deduping
behavior, it just makes deduping less necessary.
The defaults are as follows:

```javascript
{
  h1: true,
  h2: true,
  h3: true,
  h4: false,
  h5: false,
  h6: false,
}
```

<continueRight/>

`slugContributions` can help you avoid breaking existing links to pages.  If
you never had an `h1` heading, and your existing slug urls did not have any
component for the `h1` heading, you can later add an `h1` heading without
breaking existing links by configuring the `slugContributions`'s `h1` field to
be `false.`

The more headings you allow to partake in slugs, the more fragile your links
will be. But the fewer headings you allow to partake in slugs, the more
non-unique slugs you will run into (with a `-1` appended after them).

###### `sidenavify:`

Describes which headings will be added to the side nav. This will also cause
the `slugify` to be activated for this heading level even if it was set to
`false` (only slugified headings can be linked to from the side nav).
The defaults are as follows:

```javascript
{
  h1: true,
  h2: true,
  h3: true,
  h4: false,
  h5: false,
  h6: false,
}
```


## Customizing

### Add Files

You can add more markdown docs (using the `.html`) or [Stylus](stylus) files
(using the `.styl.html` extension). All new styles and html markdown pages should have the
appropriate `<script>`Then just add it to the list of `pages:`
in your `siteTemplate.html`. The `doc` and `stylus` options accept
an array of paths.

```html
<script>
Bookmark.go({
  stylus: ["./path/to/YourStyle.styl.html"],
  pages: {
    "MYNEWFILE": { }
  }
});
</script>
```
<continueRight/>

- Stylus files should have the `.styl.html` extension, and be included in the
  `stylusFetcher:`.
- Markdown files shoud have the `.md.html` extension and be included in the
  `fetcher:`


### Highlighting

Bookmark includes a vendored [hljs](hljs), and it is enabled by default in the main
script tag in `index.dev.html` that runs `Bookmark`. `hljs` is by default configured
to be the highlighter, and you can customize this.


```html
<script>
Bookmark.go({
  stylus: ...,
  pages: ...,
  highlight: (txt, lan) =>
    hljs.highlight(lan, txt).lan;
});
</script>
```
