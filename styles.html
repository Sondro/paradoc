### Styles And Stuff

Styles can be authored in plain `.css` and included in your `siteTemplate` as a
regular css file, but Paradoc also supports [Stylus](stylus) files also without
any build step/server.  Stylus config goes into files with a `.html` file (or
preferably a `.styl.html` file - for clarity), and use standard Stylus syntax,
with the exception of requiring a single single script tag on the first line,
just as with markdown files.

```css
<script src="site/Paradoc.js"></script>
.title-area
  min-height: 100px
  box-sizing: border-box
  antialias()
  text-align: center
```

<continueRight/>

The default Stylus file is
[`theme-white/theme.styl.html`](theme-white/theme.styl.html). You may edit it
and reload the page to see the changes.

> Note: Check the console for errors parsing your Stylus syntax.

Create more `.styl.html` files and add them to the list of files in the
`stylusFetcher` loaded as explained in [Adding
Files](API.html#customizing-add-files) section.

### Fonts
Paradoc comes with two vendored fonts.

- [`fonts/CodingFont.css`](./fonts/CodingFont.css): a css inlined font named
  `CodingFont`
- [`fonts/WordFont.css`](./fonts/WordFont.css) a css inlined font named
  `WordFont`

These two font names are referenced in
[`theme-white/theme.styl.html`](theme-white/theme.styl.html). `CodingFont` is
actually `Fira`, and `WordFont` is actually `Roboto`, but they have been
renamed. See their respective licenses in [fonts/](./fonts).

### Customizing Font
You can either replace `CodingFont` and `WordFont` with two css files that
contain your desired fonts, but rename those fonts to be
`CodingFont`/`WordFont` respectively. This would work well if you are replacing
those fonts with an open licensed font.

If you want to use a proprietary font when publishing your page online, but
want to keep your documentation open source, Paradoc also supports a "layered"
approach. Two additional custom fonts (`PrivateCodingFont` and
`PrivateWordFont`) are automatically prioritized if they are present in the
repo.

- [`fonts/PrivateCodingFont.css`](./fonts/PrivateCodingFont.css), if present,
  should define a css inlined font named `PrivateCodingFont`.
- [`fonts/PrivateWordFont.css`](./fonts/PrivateWordFont.css), if present,
  should define a css inlined font named `PrivateWordFont`.

These allow you to keep the `CodingFont`/`WordFont` in a public Github repo,
but then locally define these private fonts which are never pushed publicly to
a repo. This allows you to easily open source every part of your docs site
except private fonts, which you personally use locally, and will push to
production.

Once you create the propper css files in those locations that define fonts
named `PrivateCodingFont` and `PrivateWordFont` respectively, those fonts will
be used to render code examples and text respectively, otherwise the included
`CodingFont` and `WordFont`  fonts will be used as a fallback.

Note: These private fonts are not present in this github repo, but you may
populate them with your custom fonts as follows:

#### Creating Font Files:

**Creating Your Own Private Font Files:**
To create your own `PrivateCodingFont.css`/`PrivateWordFont.css` use a site
like [https://transfonter.org/](tranfonter.org) to turn your prefered fonts
into inlined CSS fonts (Select `woff`, and select the `base64` option). Then
edit the resulting CSS file to change the name of the font to
`PrivateCodingFont` or `PrivateWordFont` and place them at
[`./fonts/PrivateCodingFont.css`](./fonts/PrivateCodingFont.css) and
[`./fonts/PrivateWordFont.css`](./fonts/PrivateWordFont.css) respectively.
